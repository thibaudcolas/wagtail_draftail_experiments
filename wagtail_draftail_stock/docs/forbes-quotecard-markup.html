<p>Management complements the orchestration value proposition, providing visibility and control into orchestration environments as well as added security and other capabilities essential for running containers at the enterprise level.</p>

<p>Leading the container orchestration charge is Kubernetes, an open source effort largely out of

 </fbs-quotecard>. Docker has its own orchestration tool dubbed Swarm, but Kubernetes has the edge in terms of product maturity, and has established itself as the leader via an increasingly robust open source ecosystem.</p>
<p>Kubernetes, however, does not directly address the complexities of container management – and it’s this niche that CoreOS sought to fill with its Tectonic product. “Tectonic combines Kubernetes, the leading container management solution, with everything needed to run containers at scale,” <a href=&quot;https://coreos.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>explains</a> the CoreOS Web site. “That means the best open source components, battle-tested security systems, and fully automated operations. Tectonic is enterprise Kubernetes.”</p>
